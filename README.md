[Human Activity Recognition Using Smarphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones)

# Files

-   `CodeBook.md` a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
-   `run_analysis.R` performs the data preparation and the 5 steps required In the course project\'s definition
    -   Data Preparation.
    -   Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    -   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    -   Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    -   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    -   Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    -   FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
